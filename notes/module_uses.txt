    # TODO: make this more universal, right now it can only work for SmAsheville
    # TODO: clean this module jesus christ

database
    - includes methods used to access the database. the massive insert function should probably be
    taken out back and shot, honestly.

Sortable
    - 3rd party, only non-min'd to reference if need be

survey
    - includes back end code to use with the survey. Nothing is here yet.

    help generate a PR should go here.
